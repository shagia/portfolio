Youth Radio is a non-profit media company dedicated to featuring young voices in media, nationwide. At Youth Radio Interactive, Youth Radio’s Interactive team, I help program and design fun and accessible front end experiences that combine creative concepts and journalism. With Youth Radio’s Design team, we manage an entire pipeline that begins at conceptualization, prototyping, design and ends at the coding.

So far in my 3 years, I’ve worked on a number of projects using various jQuery frameworks including Vue and three.js, I’ve grown my skills through them and have been seeing myself improving ever since. One of my projects that I’m most proud of is a reboot of the division’s portfolio.

There were a number of attempts I've made redesigning Interactive's portfolio over the years. There was only a point last year where I created what I thought were interesting ideas. The key goals for the Interactive portfolio were:

	1. Build a quick way to not only introduce ourselves, but also our projects, giving readers a quick lowdown on us
	2. Build a straight forward user experience along with a minimalist and legible design
	3. Make it sustainable for the future (both in code and content)
